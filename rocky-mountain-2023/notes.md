## Virtual phase:
- Only did about 1h45 minutes today.
- First 4 was good. 
- 5 was not too bad but missed a single case => don't know what to do.
### Notes:
- Pretty good speed for first 4. Keep it up.
- Read the problems and take down notes. Try not to focus too much on the scoreboard until maybe after 1-2 hours.
- Read problems carefully (don't skip test cases)

## Upsolve phase:
- E: actually identified and fixed pretty fast => not bad
- Gotta start writing out all different cases before implementing on paper (especially for simulation/casework problems)
