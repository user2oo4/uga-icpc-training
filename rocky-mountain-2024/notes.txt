Ranked 5 after last submission, 2 problems less than Mines and BYU (World Finals this year)

- Overall, need to cut down on dumb mistakes 
- Always run some edge cases before submitting
- Read the code again to make sure everything is right (< vs <= is not acceptable)
- variable naming needs to be a bit better (don't reuse var names)
